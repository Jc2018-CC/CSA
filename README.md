# Slope Field Calculator

## Description
It's a Java Swing application for desktops that calculates the slope field of
whatever expression is passed in. This was created as a project by team Weebs +
Kyle for Piedmont Hills High School AP CSA for Mr. Enriquez for the year of
2022-2023.

## Instructions to Run
There's a repl [here](https://replit.com/@HarshPanchal3/csa-project) if you
want to look at the project online. You can also clone the project and compile
it with maven by running `mvn clean package` to get a jar file. If you are
lucky, I will remember to put the compiled jar file in the releases page of
this github, so you can just download and run it directly.
